Edit this file to prove that you have figure out how.
Git hub makes it really easy so that you don't have
to even have git installed. Just click on the file name
and click edit. Put some text here, put a commit message,
and then commit. We'll play with different branches later.

Right now this git repository can just be used
for the members of the group to test out githubs
functionality. Everyone please add your name to
this readme file so that I know everyone knows
how to use git. Then we can proceed to actually
use github for out code later.

Moo.
