Here are jake's personal tests. Since I have a tendency to go off on tangents, I will use this branch as a place where I don't have to hold back.

File descriptions:

gogodeX.tac - the twisted server configuration file. You WILL need to change this for your setup

backend.py - the server code

ClientRunner.java - acts as a client to run tests against the twisted server
JavaClient.java - abstracts away the java client code to make it easy to use. Used by ClientRunner.java

README - see README for more details
