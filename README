	Edit this file to prove that you have figured out how.
For this to work you need to be a collaborator so give me your
user name so that I can add you.

	Git hub makes it really easy so that you don't have
to even have git installed. Just click on the file name
and click edit. Put some text here, put a commit message,
and then commit. We'll play with different branches later.

	Although that is nice, you will want to be able to actually
edit files normally then commit them instead of typing directly
into the website. Here are the instructions on how to set that
up. They are for ubuntu but should apply to whatever system you
are using.

Install git:
sudo apt-get install git-core

Clone repository. This will put it into it's own folder called WhereAre You:
git clone git@github.com:{username}/WhereAreYou.git
If it fails at this step and says something about a key, please tell me. It
may be the case that I add everyone's public key to this repository so that
it can be authenticated.

Make a change to atleast one file:
vim README
git add README
git commit -m "My commit message"

Push it onto the master branch of this repository:
git push origin master

	Right now this git repository can just be used
for the members of the group to test out githubs
functionality. Everyone please add your name to
this readme file so that I know everyone knows
how to use git. Then we can proceed to actually
use github for out code later.

Moo.

This branch will probably never be merged. Here is code that will go
off on wild tangents as I test things. It may be useful to look at
occasionally though.

finger11.tac is the twisted server. It uses Twisted 10, pgasync, and postgres.
You will need to setup up your own database using something like psql to
test it. You will probably have to edit the pool= line to reflect your
postgres username and password.

KnockKnockClient.java is the client. It uses java. If you can figure out the
server you should not have to change this.
